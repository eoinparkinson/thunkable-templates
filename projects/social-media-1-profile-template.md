# Template Features

This template is perfect for a social media app. There are two action buttons, **Follow** and **Message**. Underneath these buttons is the brand new Data Viewer component. This can be used to display the users posts.

*Note: We will be creating a guide on this feature once there is a delete function with the new data viewer component. Stay tuned!*

There are no blocks with this template. See below in the documentation for naming scheme and changing colours.

# Template Documentation

### Profile Information:

There are 3 components which display the users information:

* Name Label
* Bio Label
* Profile Picture
* Profile Banner

Note that the **Bio Label** can cause an overlap/overflow when using more than 15-18 words. Make sure to implement a feature to stop the user from entering too many words.

### Changing Colours:

The template uses a **Dark Blue**, along with **White** and a **Mix Of Greys**. 

The blue bar at the top of the screen can be changed by setting background colour.
