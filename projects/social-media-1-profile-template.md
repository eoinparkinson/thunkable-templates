# Template Features

This template is perfect for a social media app. There are two action buttons, **Follow** and **Message**. Underneath these buttons is the brand new Data Viewer component. This can be used to display the users posts.

There are no blocks with this template, though there is a guide coming soon to create a social media feed. See below in the documentation for naming scheme and changing colours.

# Template Documentation

### Profile Information:

There are 3 components which display the users information:

* Name Label
* Bio Label
* Profile Picture
* Profile Banner

Note that the **Bio Label** can cause an overlap/overflow when using more than 15-18 words. Make sure to implement a feature to stop the user from entering too many words.

### Changing Colours:

The template uses a **Dark Blue**, along with **White** and a **Mix Of Greys**. 

##### Navigation Bar Colour:

##### Button Colour:

Changing the **Follow Button** is as easy as changing the background colour. Don't forget to change the text colour if the text becomes difficult to see!

Changing the **Message Button** is slightly different to the follow button, but nonetheless easy to do. We must change the border colour, while the background colour stays white to match the white background.

##### Content Separator Colours:

These are the two grey horizontal bars that separate content. They are named:

* Content Separator 1
* Content Separator 2

Changing the colours of these bars are very easy.

For **Content Separator 1**, we can click on the component and change its background colour:

##### Change Name and Bio Label Colours:

Both these labels are named accordingly:

* Name Label
* Bio Label

By clicking on either one of the labels, you can change the text colour to suit your theme.
