# Template Features

This template is ready to go out of the box, just input your Firebase credentials, which if you aren’t familiar with doing, you can check out our [Absolute Beginners Guide to Firebase Authentication with Thunkable X](https://thunkable-templates.netlify.app/posts/authentication/).

The **Modern Haze** template includes **10 gradients** which are designed specifically for this app. You can find a download link for these files in the template documentation below.

The app contains [alerts](https://docs.thunkable.com/alert) that appear for:

* Incorrect username or password
* User already exists
* Any other error (may contain a long error code)
* Confirming that a password reset link has been sent

The users credentials are stored in the app, so they do not have to enter a password every time they sign in. An app variable called authUserID will get the users Firebase Authentication ID and store it as an app variable. This makes it easy for storing and retrieving user-specific data from an external data source, such as the users name, bio or profile picture.

### Changing The Loading Animation:

The loading animation can be found [here](https://lottiefiles.com/21577-loading-animation).

You can use [LottieFiles](https://lottiefiles.com/)’ easy to use colour editor to change the colours to work with your own theme.

### Change The Home Screen:

![](https://thunkable-templates.netlify.app/images/testing-home-screen-preview.png)

This screen is useful for testing purposes, as it has a temporary sign out button so you can perform tests with your brand new template. You can rename the home screen and delete all data inside of it, but **do not delete the home screen**. This will cause errors that can be frustrating if you are not experienced with Thunkable.
