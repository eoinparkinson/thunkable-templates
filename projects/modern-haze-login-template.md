# Template Features

The **Modern Haze** template includes **10 gradients** which are designed specifically for this app. You can download them here.

The app contains [alerts](https://docs.thunkable.com/alert) that appear for:

* Incorrect username or password
* User already exists
* Any other error (may contain a long error code)
* Confirming that a password reset link has been sent

The users credentials are stored in the app, so they do not have to enter a password every time they sign in. An app variable called authUserID will get the users Firebase Authentication ID and store it as an app variable. This makes it easy for storing and retrieving user-specific data from an external data source, such as the users name, bio or profile picture.
