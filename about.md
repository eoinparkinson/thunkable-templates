## This site is for you, to use as much as you want, however you want.

All templates contain detailed, human friendly instructions, that guide you on how to change things up, or just make them work. Feel free to remix, adjust, add to, or break these templates, if you're into that. There aren't any rules here. 



## About the creator.

My name is Eoin, and I'm a Thunker from Co. Donegal, Ireland. I'm passionate about music, but in my spare time I like to Thunk. I created Thunkable Templates for everyone. I enjoy making these templates, and wanted to make it accessible to Thunkers around the world. All of these templates are free to use for both personal and professional use. If you like what you see here, or find these templates useful, consider spreading the word. I love to see new faces in the Thunkable Community. If you see someone stuck, be sure to help them, and if they're looking for a template, tell them to pass by here!
