So you've picked one of our beautiful templates. Now you're ready to make it work!

**All our login templates follow the same component naming structure.** This means you can use this one guide for ALL of our login templates!

# To Begin

Assuming you've chosen [one of our templates](/portfolio), open up the template. Here you're going to see 4 screens at the top of the designer tab:

* Loading
* Sign Up
* Sign In
* Home

![Step 1](/images/step-1.png)

Make sure the loading screen is at the top of the component list, which is located on the left of your designer screen.
