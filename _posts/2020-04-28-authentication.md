So you've picked one of our beautiful templates. Now you're ready to make it work!

**All our login templates follow the same component naming structure.** This means you can use this one guide for ALL of our login templates!

Also make note that you can click on an image to open it in a new tab, so you can get a good look at it.

# To Begin

Assuming you've chosen [one of our templates](/portfolio), open up the template. Here you're going to see 5 screens at the top of the designer tab:

* Loading
* Sign Up
* Sign In
* Forgot Password
* Home

*Don't worry if there are extra screens, just make sure the five screens above are there and in the order shown below.*

Make sure the loading screen is at the top of the component list, which is located on the left of your designer screen. This is shown in the image above with the blue arrow.

# The Code

Okay now we're going to start getting into it. Don't worry, it's not going to be difficult. There will be no fancy words or skipping steps. We will cover every bit of this. That way if you know a step you can skip it, and if you don't understand it, you soon will!
