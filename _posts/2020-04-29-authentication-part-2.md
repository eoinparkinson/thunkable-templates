This part of the guide will take you step by step on **adding the blocks** to work with one of our templates. If you haven't set yourself up with **Firebase** yet, you can check out [Part 1](/posts/authentication) where we take you step by step on getting started with Firebase and Thunkable X.

## Okay, let's begin!

# Part 2 - Adding The Blocks

There are going to be a lot of steps in this part, but don't let this overwhelm you. As with [Part 1](/posts/authentication), we will cover everything here too.

## Step 1:

Open back up into [x.thunkable.com](https://x.thunkable.com) and into your project which contains the login template.

## Step 2:

On the left hand side of the screen we have 2 tabs. 

* The tab at the **top** is the components that we have in our app, and they are sorted using tree view.
* The tab at the **bottom** is a list of components that we can add to our app.

Think of it like the top tab is your shopping basket and the bottom tab is the shop.

To add components we simply drag them onto our screen view. We are going to add the **Authentication** component to our project.

## Step 3:

Now that we have our Authentication component added, we can start the blocks. If you haven't already set your Firebase URL and API Key in Thunkable, pop back to [Part 1](/posts/authentication), I'll wait right here!

Sorted? Lets jump into the blocks tab. To do this we are going to bring our mouse to the top left of the screen and click on **Blocks**.
